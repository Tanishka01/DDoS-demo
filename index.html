        Distributed denial of service
    </h1>
    <div class="definition">
        A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal
        traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet 
        traffic. This flood of traffic, often generated by a large number of compromised devices or
        systems, such as computers or IoT devices, makes the targeted resource unavailable to its
        intended users.

    <div class="lets">
        Let’s have a look at a small demo of how the DDoS attack was implemented:
